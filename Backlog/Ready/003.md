# Story 3: Generate and Display the Spirograph Path as 3D Points

As a user, I want the spirograph to have a visual representation in 3D, with visible points along its path, so that I can see its structure taking shape in space.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* The spirograph points are rendered as small spheres or markers in 3D space.
* The path should feel continuous and smooth.
* Parameters like the density of points can be adjusted to affect the visual quality.

## Technical Notes:
* Use Metal to create a simple point rendering pipeline.
* Consider rendering each calculated vertex as a small sphere.
