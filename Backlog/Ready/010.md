# Story 10: Add Realistic Material Effects and Environment Mapping

**As a user,** I want the spirograph tube to have realistic material effects like reflections or transparency **so that** it looks visually striking.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* Apply environment mapping to make the spirograph tube appear reflective.
* Allow the user to switch between different materials (e.g., glassy, metallic).

## Technical Notes:
* Use a cube map for environment reflections in Metal.
* Implement fragment shaders for reflective and transparent materials.
