# Story 4: Connect Spirograph Points to Form a Contiguous Tube

**As a user,** I want to see the spirograph path visualized as a continuous tube, **so that** I can better understand its 3D shape and appreciate its complex geometry.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* The tube must be continuous along the spirograph path with smooth connections.
* The radius of the tube can be adjusted by the user.
* A “solid” representation of the spirograph is visible.

## Technical Notes:
* Extrude a circle along each segment of the path and connect them to form a smooth tube.
* Leverage Metal’s support for geometry buffers to achieve this.
* Handle different numbers of segments for the tube’s smoothness.
