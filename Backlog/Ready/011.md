# Story 11: Export the Spirograph Model

**As a user,** I want to export the 3D spirograph model as an `.obj` or `.usdz` file **so that** I can use it in other 3D applications or share it with others.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* The user can press an "Export" button to save the spirograph as a 3D model file.
* The exported file should be compatible with popular 3D modeling software.

## Technical Notes:
* Implement an export feature using SceneKit or a custom utility to write `.obj` or `.usdz` files.
* Store vertex, face, and material data in a structured format that is compatible for export.
