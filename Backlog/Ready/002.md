# Story 2: Introduce 3D Perspective to the Spirograph

As a user, I want to view the spirograph with a 3D transformation so that I can see it from different angles, which makes it visually engaging.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* The spirograph appears in a 3D space, with depth and transformations.
* The user can rotate the view of the spirograph to explore the shape.

## Technical Notes:
    * Implement a Metal transformation matrix to rotate and translate the spirograph.
    * Introduce basic perspective using an orthographic or perspective projection.
