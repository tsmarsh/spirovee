# Story 8: Add a Camera System for 3D Exploration

**As a user,** I want to be able to explore the spirograph in 3D by moving a virtual camera **so that** I can appreciate it from any viewpoint.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* The user can pan, rotate, and zoom to view the spirograph from any angle.
* Camera controls should be smooth and intuitive.

## Technical Notes:
* Implement an arcball or orbital camera system in Metal.
* Use SwiftUI gesture recognizers to control the camera's movement.
