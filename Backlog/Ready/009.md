# Story 9: Add Multiple Spirographs with Different Parameters

**As a user,** I want to see multiple spirographs rendered together with different radii, loop parameters, and colors **so that** I can observe complex interactions and overlapping patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* Multiple spirographs can be displayed in the same scene, each with different parameters.
* Each spirograph should be visually distinct (e.g., different colors).

## Technical Notes:
* Introduce data structures to manage multiple spirograph parameter sets.
* Leverage Metal's instancing capabilities to draw similar geometries efficiently.
