# Story 7: Animate the Spirograph Rendering Over Time

**As a user,** I want to see the spirograph being drawn as a growing tube, **so that** I can appreciate the dynamics of its formation.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* The spirograph starts with just a point, and the tube “grows” along the path over time.
* The user can control the speed of the growth.

## Technical Notes:
* Animate the extrusion process by progressively rendering additional vertices in each frame.
* Implement a timer-based update mechanism in Metal to progressively draw the geometry.
