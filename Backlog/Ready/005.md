# Story 5: Apply Basic Shading and Lighting to the Tube

**As a user,** I want the tube of the spirograph to have shading and lighting, **so that** I can perceive depth and texture in the model.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* The tube should react to light sources in the scene.
* Basic materials should be added to give the spirograph a metallic or glossy appearance.
* A single directional light source can be adjusted by the user.

## Technical Notes:
* Implement Phong or Lambertian shading in Metal to light the tube.
* Use Metal fragment shaders to compute the light effect based on the surface normal.
