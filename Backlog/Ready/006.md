# Story 6: Provide Real-Time Interaction to Modify Parameters

**As a user,** I want to interactively adjust parameters like tube radius, light position, and spirograph loop size **so that** I can customize the visualization and experiment with different outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* The user can interactively adjust parameters using sliders or text input.
* Changes are reflected immediately in the rendered scene.

## Technical Notes:
* Use SwiftUI to create an interface with sliders and text fields.
* Use bindings to link these inputs to real-time updates in the Metal rendering pipeline.
