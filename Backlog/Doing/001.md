# Story 1: Render a Basic 2D Spirograph on the Screen

As a user, I want to see a 2D spirograph on my screen so that I can understand the basic shape and nature of spirographs.
*	Acceptance Criteria:
*	A user can launch the app and see a basic 2D spirograph drawn on the screen.
*	The spirograph should be adjustable using simple input parameters (e.g., number of loops, size).
*	Technical Notes:
*	Implement using Metal or Core Graphics to draw a spirograph path.
*	Parameters for  R ,  r , and  d  should be exposed for user input.
